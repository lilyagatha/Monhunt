# Monster Hunter Exercise Mod (Joy-con version)

Inspired by SuperLouis64 and based on the gpc scripts he created, I have made a mod that you can play Monster Hunter (World/ Iceborne) with joy-con using Cronus Zen. 

To set up your Cronus Zen and load this scripts, you can refer to [Superlouis's Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0hKHsAgjag&ab_channel=SuperLouis64-ControllerBender) and Cronus Zen's website.


## Here are a few things to note before you use this mod:
* I'm using dual blades for this mod, not sure if it works well with other weapons, but feel free to reach me on twitter if you need help :)
* I actually put the Leg Strap on my arm to play, if you wish to use it on your leg instead, you may need to change the ACCY value on line 119


## Here is a brief guide on how to play with this mod:
| BUTTON | ACTION  |
|:-------------:| -----:|
|  | You have to move your arm to enable movement |
| PS4_TRIANGLE | Punch or lift your arm up |
| PS4_CIRCLE | Straighten your arm overhead  |
| PS4_CROSS |  You have to bend down |


## I have remap the buttons as follows:
| Original | New  |
|:-------------:| -----:|
| PS4_UP | PS4_TRIANGLE |
| PS4_DOWN | PS4_CROSS |
| PS4_LEFT | PS4_SQUARE |
| PS4_RIGHT |  PS4_CIRCLE |
| PS4_TRIANGLE | PS4_UP |
| PS4_CROSS | PS4_DOWN |
| PS4_L1 | PS4_R1 |
| PS4_R1 | PS4_L1 |
| PS4_L2 | PS4_R2 |
| PS4_R2 | PS4_L2 |


## Side note 
* You'll need to disconnect your PS4 controller from bluebooth so that you'll be able to connect your Joy-con to PS4
* Once your gpc scripts are loaded into your Cronus Zen, you dont necessarily need to build and run the script via PC everytime
* You can press the reset button at the back of Cronus Zen if the bluetooth pairing button (P2) doesnt work / only one side of Joy-con is connected
* I'm just a programming student that studied for 4 months.. so my code may not look so good :(
